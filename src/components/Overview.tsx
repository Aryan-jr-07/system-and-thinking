            Why do small and local sellers struggle to thrive on large e-commerce platforms in India, despite the promise of digital inclusion and reach?

              <b>1. Introduction to the Problem</b> <br />
              India’s informal economy contributes to nearly 50% of the nation's GDP and employs over 80% of the workforce. Despite rapid digitalisation and the rise of large e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Meesho, and Snapdeal, small and local sellers find it hard to sustain and scale their businesses online.
              This issue has deeper systemic roots — from algorithmic inequalities to logistics bottlenecks, digital illiteracy, lack of access to affordable credit, and centralised platform control. While platforms promise inclusion, the underlying structure often reinforces digital monopolies. This has created a “Digital Divide 2.0” — where even digitally present sellers are excluded from benefits.
              It’s not a failure of participation, but a failure of design, governance, and empowerment — making this a textbook systems problem that requires structural interventions rather than surface-level fixes.

              <b>2. Process Followed</b><br />
              • Identified and refined the problem using systems mapping techniques.<br />
              • Researched data from NITI Aayog, ONDC whitepapers, and academic journals.<br />
              • Conducted informal interviews with local shop owners in our community.<br />
              • Mapped out a Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) to identify feedback structures.<br />
              • Applied Donella Meadows’ Leverage Points to pinpoint actionable areas.<br />
              • Used the Iceberg Model and System Archetypes to deepen our understanding.<br />
              • Compared India’s platform economy with case studies from Kenya (Jumia), Indonesia (Tokopedia), and China (Taobao).

              <b>5. System Archetype Identified: Success to the Successful</b><br />
              Description:
              Large sellers dominate due to more sales, leading to more visibility, which again drives sales — a positive feedback loop that marginalises newcomers and small sellers. This causes entrenchment and platform centralisation.

              <b>6. Iceberg Model: Event → Pattern → Structure → Mental Model</b><br />
              Layer Example / Insight<br />
              Event
              Local artisans see zero orders despite uploading catalog to Flipkart/Meesho
              Pattern
              High churn rate among small sellers within 6–12 months of platform entry
              Structure
              High commissions, opaque search ranking, centralized warehouses, platform biases
              Mental Model
              “Online platforms are only for the big brands” – a self-defeating belief among sellers
              <br />
              <br />
              
              <b>7. Additional Insights from Research</b>
              • According to a 2022 report by CUTS International, over 65% of surveyed small sellers said that they never received orders despite being listed on platforms.
              • NITI Aayog (2023) stated that digital monopolies could lead to exclusion unless public digital infrastructure like ONDC is promoted.
              • ONDC pilot studies in Bangalore showed that local sellers could increase sales by 12–18% when platform control was decentralised.
              • Global parallels:
              o Jumia (Africa) adopted local vendor visibility scorecards to boost small seller confidence.
              o Tokopedia (Indonesia) offers community-driven mentorship to train sellers in their native languages.
              • Interviews with 5 local vendors in Patna revealed reluctance due to lack of digital understanding and fear of hidden charges.
